Improving voice, video and chat communication with free software

To improve voice, video and chat communications with free software to enable
alternatives to the commercial heavyweights like Skype or WhatsApp, and Viber.
Goals
1. Helping people to avoid using proprietary communications tools like Skype,
Viber and WhatsApp.
2. Learning about SIP, XMPP, and peertopeer
technology.
3. Simplifying the setup of free alternatives like Jitsi, Linphone, Ekiga, Tox
(qtox), Mumble and their correspondent group and conference setups.
Descriptions

When it comes to voice and video over IP, most people nowadays are quick to use
Skype, Whatsapp, or Viber. These systems come with a big community of people
though this Software is only free as free as in beer. Protocols and proprietary,
privacy is basically non existent. There are though several free alternatives like
Jitsi, Linphone, Ekiga, Tox (qtox) and Mumble. However, the communities are
often small and due to a lack of servers firewall traversal can be very cumbersome.
Even if all these techniques are also available as open source software (ice turn
server, siproxy, jitsi conference bridge, asterix, freesip), bootstrapping any business
relevant network based on these free alternatives is still hard. Automatic
dependency resolution does actually help in debian, however integration and
configuration could be greatly simplified. This project will evaluate options to
achieve this simplification and integrate necessary changes and documentation into
the respective debian packages.
